# MyPlanner

An application for managing tasks throughout a day, week, or month. 

Simple. No confusing information or tables, just your task and when it needs to be completed by.

# Future 

I intend on building onto the application in many ways. The application will allow users to have their own profile, where they can manage their own tasks if they are using the app voluntarily. If it is utilized by a company, bosses will be able to assign specific tasks to specific people, where the progress of their workload can be viewed and managed.
